# projects-Random_Name_Generator
__________
I'm creating multiple iterations of a random name generator as I learn more about programming. The random name generator project will start with a basic console, 
a console with classes, a File.IO code (that prints to a notepad), a Windows Form application.

TL;DR:   A personal project that highlights coding lessons learned and progression.
